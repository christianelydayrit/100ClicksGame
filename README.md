# 100ClicksGame

Here is the Link of the Game: https://staging.d1cb78y9ccxcny.amplifyapp.com/

This game challenges you to click as quickly as possible within a minute. It features a dynamic leaderboard that records player names and scores, where top performers can replace existing scores. Once you achieve a top spot, you remain on the leaderboard until someone surpasses your score.

To host and deploy this game, I utilized AWS Amplify for seamless integration and deployment of the web application. I leveraged AWS Lambda functions and API Gateway to manage scores and handle the leaderboard stored in a DynamoDB table. Additionally, I configured minor IAM roles to ensure secure and efficient operations across the application.
